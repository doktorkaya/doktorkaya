I worked as an AUDİTOR and RİSK RATING MANAGER in portfolio management companies in Istanbul, and I also share my experiences in columns in various newspapers and magazines. Believing that the concept of governance will bring success and peace in business life, I applied it in my working life. Behind all of my work lies a strong will, a temperament that has made working and learning a lifestyle, as well as the belief to share these experiences with the society.

The experiences I gained in student societies during my university years contributed to my working life in terms of good governance. In my student life, business and social life, I have adopted the principle of constantly improving myself on the basis of sustainable learning. I have always aimed to contribute to the society with the knowledge I have gained throughout my student and working life.

Data analysis is an inevitable part of research for capital markets and portfolio management companies. Big data analysis and data mining is the backbone of analysis studies. Analyzing the data well should be the primary goal. Accurate and well-analyzed data will bring success. Of course, the interpretation of results is critical. The application, interpretation and reporting of the analyzes should be carried out together. Data analysis with financial information is a holistic approach. Today, combining financial algorithms with asset purchase and sale transactions will provide high returns. The important thing is to write the appropriate algorithm for each investment strategy.
